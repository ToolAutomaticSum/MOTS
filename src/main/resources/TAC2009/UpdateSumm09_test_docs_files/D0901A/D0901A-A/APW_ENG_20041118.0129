India's leader in Jammu for talks with political leaders, armed
forces on troop reduction in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with Kashmiri political leaders on
Thursday during a rare visit to the Himalayan region aimed at ending
half a century of separatist violence that has claimed tens of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Singh offered to hold talks on Kashmir "with anyone and
everyone" but ruled out any redrawing of the disputed territory's
frontier, which separates Indian- and Pakistan-controlled portions of
the region.
</P>
<P>
Singh _ on his first visit as prime minister to India's Jammu-Kashmir
state _ also announced a four-year, multibillion-dollar development
plan he promised would result in thousands of jobs for people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Singh's two-day trip came as India began withdrawing some of its
troops on the border, a goodwill gesture to war-weary Kashmiris and
rival Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Singh met with members of the state Cabinet to discuss
ways to implement the economic aid package.
</P>
<P>
He was also scheduled to meet with army and paramilitary force
commanders to review a decision to reduce troops deployed in India's
Jammu-Kashmir state.
</P>
<P>
Although Singh's visit was largely welcomed by Kashmiris, many were
inconvenienced after security forces barricaded the main streets of
Jammu, the state's winter capital, ahead of his arrival. Children and
office workers trudged to their schools and offices after public
buses were halted as part of the stringent security measures in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan but both claim the
region in its entirety. India accuses Pakistan of arming Muslim
insurgents fighting for the region's independence or merger with
Islamic Pakistan. Islamabad denies that.
</P>
<P>
Talks with Kashmiri separatists began last year under Singh's
predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Singh indicated his government
also would press to end tensions with Kashmiri militants and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
But Singh shrugged off a suggestion by Pakistani President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf last month that some areas of Kashmir be made
independent, placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or put
under United Nations administration.
</P>
<P>
"Any redrawing of the international borders is not something that is
going to be acceptable to us," Singh said.
</P>
<P>
Singh also Wednesday addressed a rally of some 12,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"I have come here with the realization and hope that I can understand
what your aspirations and desires are," he said, barely visible as he
spoke from behind a bulletproof screen.
</P>
<P>
India has cited a decline in separatist violence as the main reason
for its troop withdrawal, which reportedly will be about 40,000 of
the half-million stationed in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
But a gunbattle launched by militants hours before Singh's visit
underscored the fragile security of the region. Two militants were
killed and two soldiers and a civilian wounded in the attack near the
rally site, security forces said.
</P>
<P>
Singh announced an economic development plan for Kashmir that would
spend 71 billion rupees (US$1.5 billion, euro1.16 billion) next year,
part of a 240 billion rupee (US$5.3 billion, euro4.1 billion) outlay
over four years. Some of the money will come from international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The funds would go to building new roads and schools, and developing
infrastructure for water, power and health care. The initiatives are
expected to create 24,000 new jobs, including 14,000 for women.
</P>
<P>
Creating employment for young people in Jammu-Kashmir was also a
priority, Singh said, adding a ban on recruitment for government jobs
will be lifted. The countrywide ban on government hiring was part of
measures to downsize India's bloated public sector.
</P>
<P>
"The ban will not apply to Jammu-Kashmir since youth in the state are
facing hardships in getting jobs," Singh told a crowd of about 15,000
in Jammu.
