violation

<P>
Indian and Pakistani military 
commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan 
fired mortar shells across the border into Indian-controlled Kashmir 
in violation of a 14-month ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The director-generals of military operations of the 
nuclear-armed neighbours were slated to talk by telephone about the 
incident that occurred late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The director generals of military operations will be talking 
later today," an Indian government official said, declining to be 
named. "The Pakistani side has denied firing. Let's see."
</P>
<P>
The time of the hotline call between the Indian and Pakistani 
officials was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Islamabad denied it had violated the ceasefire in 
the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, spark of two of three wars 
between Indian and Pakistan, and over which they skirmished in 
2002.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan began the ceasefire November 25, 2003, after 
routinely exchanging artillery fire across the volatile Line of 
Control, the de facto border separating their armies in Kashmir, as 
part of a tentative peace process.
</P>
<P>
"No one from Pakistan has fired and there is no ceasefire 
violation by Pakistan," Pakistan military spokesman Major General 
Shaukat Sultan told AFP in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The firing was front-page news in Indian newspapers. "Pakistan 
opens fire across Line of Control," said The Hindu.
</P>
<P>
Indian police said Tuesday at least one person was injured when 
about 15 mortars were fired into India from Pakistan over the Line 
of Control.
</P>
<P>
The mortars came from across the border Tuesday evening and 
landed in India's Durga Post area in the Poonch sector, an Indian 
police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Indian army officer Major General D. Samanwar told NDTV news 
channel the incident was tantamount to a ceasefire violation.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it certainly is a violation. It's the first time it has 
happened but we've exercised full restraint," he said, adding troops 
had been put on alert.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been engaged in formal peace talks to 
normalise relations since January 2004.
